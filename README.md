## 1. Code

We share with you 2 python notebooks where you run and tweak the code to understand stable diffusion.

### a) Grokking Stable Diffusion

The [notebook](https://github.com/vlgiitr/AI_Art_Workshop_2023/blob/master/Grokking_Stable_Diffusion_Public.ipynb) takes you through how stable diffusion works, allows you to create your own creations and also has detailed explanations about each component that goes into creating an image and lets you play with a ton of different parameters so that you get a good understanding of the concepts involved.

### b) Panaroma

This [notebook](https://github.com/vlgiitr/AI_Art_Workshop_2023/blob/master/paranoma.ipynb) creates a bunch of images based on your prompt and stitches them together to create a panaromic view of the requested prompt.
